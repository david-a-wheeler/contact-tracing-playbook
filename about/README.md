# About USDR

U.S. Digital Response \(USDR\) helps governments meet the challenges of the COVID-19 crisis by strengthening decision-making and supporting their ability to effectively deliver critical services to the public at scale. 

We are a volunteer-run, non-partisan effort to help federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments with technology, data, design, operations, communications, project management, and more during the COVID-19 crisis. We provide free assistance to all government entities across the country; if we can help, we will.

USDR was founded by former U.S. Deputy CTOs and seasoned tech industry veterans who led federal open data policies, and started up the U.S. Digital Service. [Learn more about our **Mission and Values**.](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/mission-values)
