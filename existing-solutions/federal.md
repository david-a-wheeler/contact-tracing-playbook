In [a letter to congress](https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=6877567-Bipartisan-Public-Health-Leaders-Letter-on) on 5/27/2020, bipartisan health experts recommended congress spend $12b to hire 180,000 federal contract tracing workers over next 18 months. The Center for Disease Control has 500 staff to help state & local health departments and will allocate 650 more positions to do so.
