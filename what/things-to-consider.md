* Figure out your policy strategy around persons of interest definition, i.e. lab testing, confirmatory testing, CDC guidelines or your own case definitions, symptom checkers
* Pin down your authoritative sources of case reports
* Identify your existing data systems and sources for persons of interest; syndromic surveillance, health system case reports, community organization case reports
* Pin down additional contact tracing criteria that arenâ€™t tied to persons of interest at the population and geographic level, i.e. known and emerging hotspots, vulnerable and at-risk populations
