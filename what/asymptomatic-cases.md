# Asymptomatic cases

[As many as 43% of COVID-19 cases may be asymptomatic](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20053157v1). The protocol outlined above neither identify nor tests asymptomatic contacts. While all contacts are subject to a 14-day quarantine, untested asymptomatic cases will “slip through the cracks”, making it critical that contact tracing be implemented aggressively in response to _every_ known and diagnosed case of COVID-19--regardless of whether the diagnosed case is experiencing symptoms.
