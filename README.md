Contact tracing for COVID-19

# Why contact tracing

In the battle against COVID-19, [contact tracing is one of five essential and interdependent public health strategies][1], along with social distancing, testing, isolation & quarantine, and treatment, that will enable us to safely reopen our societies while continuing to flatten the curve.

   [1]: https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/its-not-too-late-to-go-on-offense-against-the-coronavirus&sa=D&ust=1588651025639000

Contact tracing is a core public health function, and the techniques and strategies for contact tracing are not new. The US government's Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the broader public health community [have long depended on contact tracing to][2][ help control highly communicable diseases][2] like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and syphilis. 

   [2]: https://www.cdc.gov/eis/field-epi-manual/index.html&sa=D&ust=1588651025640000

However, the unprecedented scale and speed with which COVID-19 is impacting communities requires us to implement time-tested contact tracing strategies in new ways, using new tools and technologies. This will require substantial investments in time, resources, and budget, as well as continued collaboration across federal, state, and local health departments.

We learn more about contact tracing for COVID-19 every day. This playbook collects what various government, policy, and public health communities have shared far about scaling contact tracing programs. We link to resources, frameworks, and templates to help you consider how to implement basic contact tracing in your community. Note that high-risk communities (e.g., correctional, healthcare, or long-term care) may require additional support beyond the scope of this playbook.

# What is contact tracing

Contact tracing involves [identifying people who may have come into contact ("contacts") with an infected person ("case") and then subsequent monitoring of said contacts' health][3]. We outline below how the three core steps of contact tracing can be used to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. 

   [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing&sa=D&ust=1588651025641000

Most federal, state, and local public health departments already implement contact tracing for other communicable diseases, meaning your jurisdiction likely already has dedicated infrastructure and budget. Elsewhere in this playbook we'll address how to think about workforce expansion and building on existing infrastructure. 

Have questions? We're here to help: CONTACT@USDIGITALRESPONSE.ORG[c][d]

### Three core steps

  1. Contact the confirmed case ("Case identification")

  1. Interview the confirmed case (i.e., person diagnosed with COVID-19), likely by one-on-one telephone interview, and determine symptoms, date of exposure, infectious period, and high-risk conditions.
  2. Provide the case with education on COVID-19.
  3. Provide the case with instructions on isolation and connect to any additional support needed (e.g., nutrition, social services, housing).
  4. Elicit all possible exposed contacts during infectious period.

  1. Notify, interview, and quarantine contacts ("Contact location and notification")

  1. Identify contacts if necessary and locate contact information.
  2. Engage contacts to notify them of their exposure.
  3. Provide education on COVID-19.
  4. Provide contact with recommendation/referral for clinical evaluation and appropriate testing if symptoms are present. If test results are positive, the person would require full case investigation in order to elicit their contacts.
  5. Provide instructions on quarantine and connect to any additional support needed (e.g., nutrition, social services, housing).

  1. 14-day contact monitoring ("Contact follow-up")

  1. Ensure daily temperature checks and symptom monitoring for 14 days since last contact with the confirmed case.
  2. Ensure continued quarantine of contact for 14 days since last contact to the confirmed case.
  3. Provide contact with recommendation/referral for clinical evaluation and appropriate testing if symptoms develop. If test results are positive, the person would require full case investigation in order to elicit their contacts.

### Asymptomatic cases

[As many as 43% of COVID-19 cases may be asymptomatic][4]. The protocol outlined above neither identify nor tests asymptomatic contacts. While all contacts are subject to a 14-day quarantine[e], untested asymptomatic cases will "slip through the cracks", making it critical that contact tracing be implemented aggressively in response to every known and diagnosed case of COVID-19--regardless of whether the diagnosed case is experiencing symptoms.

### Manual vs. digital

Summary of findings, pros and cons and limitations at this point[f][g][h][i][j][k]

   [5]: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/digital-contact-tracing.pdf&sa=D&ust=1588651025645000

### Who is responsible

In many cases, local departments of health will implement contact tracing in partnership with state budget and infrastructure. Especially large or dense urban centers, however, as well as local jurisdictions with unique circumstances, may execute contact tracing independently of--but in communication with--state funding. To remain capable of responding quickly to this crisis, The National Association of County and City Health Officials [encourages proposals to remain flexible regarding how funding and resources are allocated between jurisdictions][6]. 

   [6]: https://www.naccho.org/uploads/full-width-images/Contact-Tracing-Statement-4-16-2020.pdf&sa=D&ust=1588651025645000

Government partners may want to outline how responsibilities will be distributed, considering, for example, whether workflows like contact tracer staffing or data management should occur at the state or local level. They should also establish whether partners can selectively or entirely "opt-out" of portions of any program while still receiving services and/or funding.

We recommend that states charter task forces to review these options before stepping down stay-at-home orders. Key stakeholders include local and state public health, technology t, local health departments where they exist, leaders in healthcare data interoperability, and other relevant state officials overseeing legal services, health equity, and health data integrity.

### Things to consider[l][m][n]

  * Figure out your policy strategy[o] around persons of interest definition[p], i.e. lab testing, confirmatory testing, CDC guidelines[q] or your own case definitions, symptom checkers[r]
  * Pin down your authoritative sources of case reports
  * Identify your existing data systems and sources for persons of interest; syndromic surveillance, health system case reports, community organization case reports
  * Pin down additional contact tracing criteria that aren't tied to persons of interest at the population and geographic level,  i.e. known and emerging hotspots, vulnerable and at-risk populations
  * Survey

# Existing COVID-19 contact tracing programs

Governments can learn from the COVID-19 contact tracing programs being scaled by other state and local governments. 

### State

#### Massachusetts

Massachusetts established the country's first state-wide contact tracing program, the [Community Tracing Collaboration (CTC)][7], in early April with a budget of $44m and a plan to hire more than 1,000 contact tracers ([job posting][8]) for the state's 7 million residents. The CTC involves multiple state organizations, including the [Massachusetts Department of Public Health][9][ (MDPH)][9] and the [Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority][10][ (CHICA)][11], along with public health organization [Partners in Health (PiH)][12] and consulting firm [Accenture][13]. The CTC empowers the decentralized state's 351 local health departments to execute contact tracing in every city and town in Massachusetts, and had spoken to over 5,000 residents by the close of April.

Contact tracing staff are joined by 1700+ academic public health volunteers from the state's colleges and universities who have been supporting the state's contact tracing efforts.

#### North Dakota

North Dakota currently leads the country in contact tracing, with 352 trained contact tracers for its 762,000 residents. It is hiring for multiple roles related to data management and contact tracing program through its [Workforce Coordination Center][20].

   [20]: https://ndresponse.gov/covid-19-resources/get-involved-how-you-can-help&sa=D&ust=1588651025652000

#### North Carolina

North Carolina launched its own Community Tracing Collaborative and is hiring 500 people ([job posting][21]).

#### Michigan

Michigan announced a plan to hire 3.5k volunteers for contact tracing as part of [a state-wide effort][22], and has since trained over 2k, but has since slowed efforts after it increased scrutiny around its contracts related to the effort. 

   [22]: http://michigan.gov/fightcovid19&sa=D&ust=1588651025653000

### Local

#### San Francisco[s]

San Francisco's city-county Health Department has formed a task force in partnership with University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) to support its 883,305 residents. The SF Department of Public Health envisions a team of 150 medical students, city librarians, city attorneys.

#### New York City

The New York City Fund for Public Health is [currently hiring more than 1,000 contact tracers][23], paying $57k with benefits.

### Federal

In [a letter to congress][25] on 5/27/2020, bipartisan health experts recommended congress spend $12b to hire 180,000 federal contract tracing workers over next 18 months. The Center for Disease Control  has 500 staff to help state & local health departments and will allocate 650 more positions to do so.

# How to do it

To effectively execute contact tracing for COVID-19, most governments will need to support:

  * Workforce expansion
  * Laboratory testing
  * Isolation and quarantine
  * Monitoring and evaluation
  * Data management systems
  * Technology enablement
  * Defining roles

In the coming sections we review strategies organizations can use to quickly increase capacity in each of these areas.

## Workforce Expansion

While contact tracing is routinely performed to control STDs, TB, and other communicable diseases, local health departments have limited front-line workforce (e.g., epidemiologists, disease intervention staff, public health nurses) to support contact tracing at the scale and pace of COVID-19. The [CDC provides resources][26] for training and supplementing existing staff for ongoing and surge support.

   [26]: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/staffing.html&sa=D&ust=1588651025656000

### Population-based estimates

For contact tracing to be effective, every diagnosed case must be investigated, which means the contact tracing workforce must be capable of responding quickly even during surges. [Find the number of staff you'll need][27] using this calculator provided by public health organization [Resolve to Save Lives][28], and review additional estimates below.

## Laboratory testing

Increasing testing capacity and ensuring rapid turnaround time (from symptoms, to testing, to test result delivery to both the patient and the health department) are key to "slowing the spread".

### Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing 

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing is [the current gold standard][32] for COVID-19. For contact tracing to be most effective, PCR testing should be widespread and available to all people showing symptoms. The CDC provides [detailed recommendations for testing protocol and best practices][33].

   [32]: https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/diagnostics/testing-tests-which-covid19-tests-are-most-accurate&sa=D&ust=1588651025672000
   [33]: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html&sa=D&ust=1588651025672000

### Asymptomatic testing

There is [increasing evidence of transmission from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases][34], and it is likely that a significant proportion of patients would test positive for COVID-19 without symptoms (e.g., [20% in South Korea; 50% in Iceland][35]).

   [34]: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6914e1.htm&sa=D&ust=1588651025673000
   [35]: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-22/one-third-of-coronavirus-cases-may-show-no-symptom-scmp-reports&sa=D&ust=1588651025673000

Contact tracing will not prevent transmission from untested asymptomatic cases. Because asymptomatic testing accuracy and feasibility rates are still preliminary, even if communities do test asymptomatic contacts, negative results would not change quarantine recommendations. The CDC [provides guidance on testing asymptomatic contacts][36] of people diagnosed with COVID-19.

   [36]: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/guidance-evaluating-pui.html&sa=D&ust=1588651025674000

### Serology testing 

Serology testing for COVID-19 to identify past infection and presumed immunity is [still being developed][37], and its role and potential use in contact tracing is still unclear. In particular, [sensitivity and specificity of serology tests vary widely][38] and must be further validated before guiding decision-making.

   [37]: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/serology-testing.html&sa=D&ust=1588651025674000
   [38]: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.25.20074856v1&sa=D&ust=1588651025674000

## Isolation and quarantine 

Isolation (the separation of persons with confirmed or suspected contagious disease) and quarantine (separation/restriction of movement of persons that have been exposed to a contagious disease) are critical to stopping COVID-19 transmission. 

Enforcing isolation and quarantine requires resources and systems, including strategies for securing location and ensuring food, nutrition, and medication, and financial support.[u] People in isolation and quarantine require continued monitoring in case they require further care or testing.

### Location

Case investigators and contact tracers[v][w] will assess the most appropriate place for isolation and quarantine--either at home, in a government-secured location (e.g., hotel), or in a hospital. 

### Provisions

Care resource managers ensure access to nutrition and required medications, whether by neighbor, friend, family member, or delivery service. 

### Other needs

Case investigators? should assess for potential challenges of isolation and quarantine, including loss of income and loss of ability to care for others, that may make compliance difficult. Public health programs such as tuberculosis control programs have provided "incentives and enablers" for this purpose[x]. Examples include covering mortgage or rent payments, providing daycare or elder care, and others. Direct financial compensation for those with lost wages should be considered.

### Legal authority

Health officers have legal authority to order isolation and quarantine[y]. Local programs may vary in their approach. Some issue orders immediately whereas others seek voluntary cooperation without a legal order initially. States may need to provide additional support if local health departments need mass provision, monitoring, or enforcement of legal orders. [z][aa]

## Program evaluation

Governments can use predefined performance targets to determine the efficacy of its contact tracing program. These metrics can be used in tandem with broader metrics tracking cases and mortality rate to consider loosening and tightening social restrictions.

### Example metrics and targets for contact tracing[ab][ac]

Possible criteria to loosen restrictions

Possible criteria to tighten restrictions

Other performance metrics

  * 100% of cases interviewed for contact elicitation/ identification
  * Contacts elicited for at least 90% of cases
  * 100% of symptomatic contacts and others with symptoms undergo testing within 12 hours of identification of symptoms

  * Cannot elicit contacts for 20% or more of cases
  * 10% or more of symptomatic contacts fail to get tested or are tested in more than 24 hours of symptom onset

  * % of cases with complete contact information
  * % of cases reached by case investigator within 12 hours of positive lab result
  * % of cases providing at least one contact to investigator
  * % of contacts with complete contact information
  * % of contacts reached by contact tracer within 24 hours of elicitation

## Data management

Contact tracing requires and produces a lot of data, particularly given current all-remote shelter-in-place workforce, making efficient data management crucial to any program's success.

[Flow chart of data here]

### Principles of data management

  1. Make collected data accessible: The format of a positive laboratory test result for COVID-19, as well as the necessary associated patient information, should be accessible to both clinical and public health entities in either "near real time" or in aggregate as necessary. Ideally patient data is ultimately shared with the patient's provider.
  2. Import relevant available health data: A system capable of automatically importing relevant prior contact, demographic, and clinical records would substantially reduce the burden on the contact tracing and medical workforce. Regulatory barriers to accessing this information (e.g., HIPAA Minimum Necessary restriction) can be overcome with a [statement from the federal HHS Office of Civil Rights][39] or an assertion from the State.
  3. Make data usable: Investing in the above principles to aggregate and access relevant health information will be wasted if contact tracers and other public health employees aren't clear on how to access it and then share relevant recommendations with cases and contacts. Ideally, programs have easy-to-use user interfaces for data review and entry, but, alternatively, detailed visual training programs can ensure the workforce is taking advantage of useful data.

   [39]: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/minimum-necessary-requirement/index.html&sa=D&ust=1588651025681000

### Negotiating data rights with vendors

Software vendors may attempt to contract their ownership over data in an attempt to lock in customers. Programs must avoid this by specifying in the vendor contract that vendors do not own any data via a "data rights" clause such as:

"Consistent with [FAR 52.227-14][40], which applies to this agreement, the State intends that data stored within the software provided by the Contractor will be owned by the State."

   [40]: https://www.acquisition.gov/content/52227-14-rights-data-general&sa=D&ust=1588651025682000

Programs must also specify in the vendor contract that the vendor agrees to export records in a machine-readable format (defined as "data in a format that can be easily processed by a computer without human intervention while ensuring no semantic meaning is lost"), and the software must likewise be demonstrated to provide such functionality. 

## Legal & data sharing frameworks

Summary:

  * Establish legal data sharing frameworks within state jurisdictions, e.g. local/municipality to city (major metro), and direct to state.
  * Consider formulating policies and orders at the local jurisdiction level that refer to specific data sharing regulations that permit reporting; i.e. healthcare providers having the ability to share data with specific entities related to contact tracing efforts and what data will be released for broad public consumption vs. restricted public health use[ad].
  * Designate certain collaborative entities with limited public health authority related to COVID-19[ae] e.g. Health Information Networks, and Health Information Exchanges typically can't easily share data bi-directionally with public health; state-based entities (e.g. New Jersey Health Information Network, Indiana HIE, SHINY[af]) will be able to move faster on sharing clinical information with public health to scope contact tracing efforts
  * Define data sharing use cases that fall under the following:

  * Public Health Practice
  * De-identified Data (per HIPAA); aggregate and line-level
  * Consumer Data (non-HIPAA; regulated by FTC
  * Anonymous Data
  * Open Data (public consumption)[ag]

  * Patient and Consumer Consents[ah]
  * Data destruction policies[ai]

### State & Local Jurisdiction Data Sharing

If there is a local NEDSS system[aj] in place, provide local jurisdictions with the ability to enter case reports. Establish a process to capture case investigations that relate to emerging contract tracing emergence of symptoms but confirmatory testing may not be in place yet (typically a quarantine section of the system to help prioritize confirmed case reports).

### Data Sharing Use Cases

  * Symptom checker information into a NEDSS
  * Symptom checker information connected with contact traced social network (identifiable, and aggregate level)
  * Contact-traced individuals to healthcare records/testing (consent)
  * Surveillance of negatives for a certain period of time with symptom checker & monitoring tools

#### Public Health Practice[ak]

Covers the following:

  * Healthcare provider to public health
  * Clinical data provider (Labs, EHRs, Payors & their vendors) to public health
  * Behavioral and mental health data provider to public health[al]
  * Public health to public health; state and local jurisdictions
  * Local state agencies (e.g. Departments of Human Services, Prison & Correctional Facilities) to public health
  * Local public health to federal public health

Permissible data linkages:[am]

  * Identifiable data (PHI or PII)  to consumer-consented data
  * Limited data to identifiable data
  * De-identified data to identifiable data (re-identification under public health practice)
  * De-identified data to de-identified data

#### De-identified Data

Covers the following:

  * Healthcare providers to public health[an]

#### Consumer Data

#### Open Data

## How to fulfill and scale each roles and functions -- human and tech enablement

## Technology enablement

Technology cannot remove the need for scaled-up workforces to execute contact tracing. However, technology will enable contact tracing workforces to effectively address the unprecedented scale, speed, and accuracy demanded by the COVID-19 crisis. Cloud-based technology tools can accelerate key functions including:

  * Workforce management
  * Case management
  * Alerts
  * Call center and triage

Most government organizations already have contact tracing infrastructure and technology support in place for infectious diseases like HIV or syphilis, but this technology may not be easy to adapt to contact tracing for COVID-19. A good first step is to review your existing workflow and infrastructure and use the following checklist to identify where you might need to invest in new technologies (versus where your current solution will be sufficient):

Priority

Task

Requirements

Recommended solutions

High

Transfer positive test results from labs to the health department

24-hour time window

Set up secure electronic integrations between labs and your state, county, and cities[ao]

Low

Minimize data entry errors, clean/correct them when they occur

Ability to flag errors 

Electronic lab registration software

Data auto-correct

Medium

View/find contact information for the positive case

Reconcile conflicting test results

Stack rank cases

Access management

Get in touch with the positive patient and find to inform them of their diagnosis, connect them to care, and interview them about their contacts (this is not always done by the same person or at the same time)

Interview the positive patient about their contacts (that they might have exposed or might have exposed them), and prioritize based on likelihood of transmission

Decide which contacts will be notified by the positive patient vs the health department [("provider referral" vs "patient referral"][41])

   [41]: https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/44/Supplement_3/S160/496779&sa=D&ust=1588651025697000

For contacts that will be notified via patient referral, equip the patient with information and possibly referral cards

Decide whether to give the patient medication to bring their contacts ("expedited partner therapy"), and if so provide them with the necessary medication and instructions[ap]

Find contact information for the positive patient's contacts who will be notified by the health department

Get in touch with the contact and find a time to talk to them

Inform the contact of their possible exposure, and connect them to testing & care as appropriate

Sometimes, follow up with contact to see whether they were tested

Train contact tracers on how to perform contact tracing effectively and ensure the privacy of patients and contacts

### Tech-enabled case identification, management, & prioritization[aq]

Your underlying database of positive cases was not built for COVID-19. You might use the state's system to source new cases, or your county or city might have its own. Test results will come in from hospitals, clinics, private labs, and public labs. These results might come in electronically through an online integration or portal as HL7 feeds, CSVs, or other raw data files. They also might be entered in by hand to the city or state database from someone directly looking up information about the case in the clinic's EMR (electronic medical record) system, by someone who has received a paper copy of the lab, or by a courier who has brought an electronic file to the city, county, or state on a thumb drive, CD-ROM, or floppy drive. Ideally, you would set up secure electronic integrations between labs and your state, county, and cities so that data can be sent instantly and without alteration[ar].

Even if you are able to get electronic data directly from the lab, the data from the lab will not be free of typos. Patient names and contact information will inevitably be misspelled, because usually this information is hand-written by the patient on a paper form, and then manually typed in by someone at the lab or by the healthcare provider. Anywhere along the chain, technology can play a role in flagging and even automatically correcting common errors, such as "gnail.com" or "gmail.con." The earlier along the chain this correction happens, the better. Technologies that enable patients to register electronically during or before their visit to the lab, and that conduct field checks on the data entered by the patient (e.g. a phone number is missing a digit), will help ensure that the data seen by contact tracers is accurate.

Your system might also need to adapt to treat patients who were never tested or whose test results are pending as presumptive positives in need of care and/or contact tracing. Lab data alone will not then get you the information you need, and further integrations and processes to get data from providers will be necessary.

In addition to getting data from providers and labs, your system will need to know how to interpret those data to flag what cases should be interviewed. A patient could be tested twice with a PCR test on the same day, and have one test come back positive and another negative. A patient could get tested for antibodies and have a positive antibody test, but no longer be worthwhile to interview for contact tracing. Your database and processes will need to handle patients getting tested more than once, with multiple types of tests that mean different things, at many different locations. 

Even with a large number of contact tracers, you will need to have the ability to prioritize among positive patients, and your database needs to have the information in it that would guide this prioritization. Examples of data that would be useful (beyond "test result negative vs positive") include:

  * Date of test
  * Type of test
  * Date of symptom onset (might not be available in lab data, but is helpful for determining infectious period & original date of infection)
  * Other test results for the same patient
  * Risk factors (?)

Lastly, your contact tracers need to have access to the database of patients they need to interview ("index cases"), and know which ones to reach out to. This does not need to be the same database your health department uses because: 

  * COVID-19 contact tracers only need access to data about a subset of all infectious disease patients, and a subset of COVID-19 cases
  * your department database might not be accessible to people who are not in-person using health department desktops
  * there might not be an underlying need for your department database to have information about COVID-19 contacts in it

If you do separate your systems, you'll need to figure out how to get data from your department database of cases into any database / technology being used by contact tracers, and identify which of these databases is the "source of truth" on COVID-19 cases. If it's your department database, you'll want to develop a process or integration that allows contact tracers to flag things that are "off" about COVID-19 patient information, such as a disconnected phone number or an email that bounces back, and ensure that information can be corrected in both the database that contact tracers are using and the database being used by the department for the tracking and management of COVID-19 cases. 

### Tech-enabled case interviews, contact elicitation, & contact investigation

Once you have your database of cases, cases need to be informed of their diagnosis and interviewed. Quite a bit needs to happen in order to connect the index case to care, ensure they are less likely to infect others (e.g. connect them to an isolation hotel if they can't isolate at home), and elicit contacts. You'll need to decide who is in charge of what part of this, and whether the person interviewing a patient about their contacts and possible sources of exposure is also performing other functions such as delivering test results or connecting patients to care. If they are performing these other functions, you'll want to ensure that any database they use allows them to track these activities appropriately.

Technology can play an important role in delivering test results, and even in helping supplement contact elicitation interviews that would otherwise be done on the phone. Some health departments are using third-party vendors like [Healthvana][42] to deliver COVID-19 test results and instruct positive patients on which contacts to notify and how to notify them. Index case interviews can be done digitally as well, by having patients fill out an online form about their close contacts and recent activities[as]. These forms are not perfect - not all index cases will feel comfortable filling them out or have private internet access, the form won't be able to ask probing questions that an interviewer might, and a form can't build rapport or demonstrate empathy the way a human can. But these forms can scale well, can be available in multiple languages, can be filled out by the patient at any time, and can improve the speed of and accuracy of data collection versus a traditional interview. 

   [42]: http://healthvana.com&sa=D&ust=1588651025708000

Technology can also help with prompting the index patient to remember their contacts or possible exposures. An interviewer can ask an index case to look at their calendar, their text messages, their food delivery apps, their phone geolocation data, and other sources of private electronic tracking and communication that can help the case to remember when their symptoms started, where they've been, and who they had in-person contact with.

In addition to trying to elicit the names of contacts, an interviewer will also try to identify ways to reach out to the contact. The index case might have a variety of ways they communicate with or can locate their close contacts, some of which can be used by contact tracers and others that are best suited for conversations just between the patient themselves and their contact. These could include:

  * Phone number
  * Email address
  * Username in various social media platform (e.g. dating apps, facebook, instagram, etc)
  * Physical address
  * Place of work or places commonly visited

Technology can support this by enabling the index case to search through their various contact lists for multiple methods of getting in touch with their close contacts. This could be done by an app the index case would download onto their smartphone, and then setting up integrations with their phone's contact list, their email client, and their social media apps. The index case could then search for a given contact's names in all digital locations simultaneously, enabling them to more easily notify those contacts themselves or provide this information to the interviewer.

Once some information about a contact is given to an interviewer, they might want to do their own search for methods of contacting them, especially if the methods provided by the index case don't seem to be working. This is also true for instances where the lab provides incomplete information about the index case themselves. Technology can make it easier to search multiple databases simultaneously to try to find alternate methods for contacting individuals.

### Tech-enabled contact prioritization & notification

Once contacts have been elicited, they need to be prioritized for follow-up by contact tracers. In traditional contact tracing, often not every case is notified by the health department, or at least not for all infectious diseases. Often the patient themselves is asked to notify their close contacts as well, and provided with help doing so. This is for several reasons:

  * Index patients might not want to provide contact tracers with the names of all their close contacts, especially if the contact is undocumented or if one or both parties were not following local ordinances when they were in touch
  * Contacts might not answer the phone when called from an unknown number, or open an email from an unknown email address, whereas they would pick up if a friend was calling
  * Health departments rarely have the capacity to reach out to all possible contacts, and want to focus their resources on hard-to-reach contacts that can't be notified by other means

In addition to prioritizing contacts based off of which need to be contacted via provider-referral (vs peer-to-peer patient referral), a health department might also want to prioritize contacts who:

  * Are especially likely to have been infected by the index case. This would be influenced by: 

  * the timing of the interaction - e.g. contacts who were with the index case three days before symptoms appeared would be less likely to be infected than a contact from the day after symptoms appeared
  * the duration of the interaction - e.g. contacts who were with the index case for 3 hours would be more likely to be infected than those who spent two minutes with the patients
  * the location of the interaction - e.g. contacts who were indoors or in a contained environment like a car with the patient would be more likely to be infected than those who were outside in a park (we think)
  * whether the index patient was coughing or engaging in behavior that would increase the probability that an infectious dose of the virus would leave their body and enter the other person

  * Are especially likely to infect others, if not notified and/or provided with services, for example:

  * Individuals who live in close quarters with other people
  * Individuals who are working essential jobs and leaving their home regularly 

  * Are especially likely to develop serious illness, if not notified and/or provided with services, for example:

  * Older individuals
  * Individuals with relevant underlying conditions or who are immunocompromised

  * Are especially likely to have infected the index case, for example:

  * Close contacts from 2-14 days, especially around 3-6 days, from before the index case started to show symptoms
  * These are generally prioritized less highly for provider-referral notification, because these contacts might already be past their infectious period

Technology can play an important role in sorting through and prioritizing these contacts on these various vectors, enabling health departments to more rapidly prioritize who to notify in what order, and how much effort to expend on contacts who are not easily reached.

In addition to supporting contact prioritization, technology can help with the notification itself. This can be done by providing contact tracers with templates for outreach that they can use for manual emailing or texting of contacts. This can also be done by automatically alerting contacts using pre-set templates (e.g. the software sends the text message rather than the contact tracer using their own phone), or with robo-calls to contacts. These interactions can be tracked or automated in a database such as Salesforce, enabling contact tracers to easily see that status of outreach to contacts. 

In addition to supporting the sending of a contact notification, technology can help with connecting the contact to testing and / or care. A number of COVID-19 testing location finders exist, such as [Google][43] or [findcovidtesting.com][44].

### Tech-enabled contact follow-up

Once a contact has been notified, you may want to follow up with them to ensure they have been tested, encourage them to stay isolated for the 14 days after exposure, and learn more about their symptoms. An increasing number of technologies are being developed to support this, such as [CommCare][45] or [Sara Alert][46].

### Peer-to-peer contact notification

Technology can also support patients in notifying their close contacts themselves, if they know their identities. 

Anonymous peer-to-peer partner notification systems for STDs have been in place for a number of years, such as [Tell Your Partner][47], [Let Them Know][48], and [others][49]. These sites were designed to enable index patients to alert a number of contacts simultaneously, while keeping the patient anonymous. It is unclear whether the anonymous nature of these systems will be needed for COVID-19, given there is likely less stigma involved. And any anonymous system could be abused, and might not be taken seriously by the recipient of the notification messaged. But the ability to rapidly and simultaneously alert a large number of contacts without health department resources being spent is appealing. These technologies are beginning to be adapted to support COVID-19 peer-to-peer notification, such as [Tell Your Contacts][50].

   [47]: https://tellyourpartner.org/&sa=D&ust=1588651025715000

   [50]: https://tellyourcontacts.org/&sa=D&ust=1588651025716000

This concept could also be adapted to enable patients to easily non-anonymously notify their close contacts themselves via text messages from their own number or emails from their own email. 

In addition to helping the index patient deliver the message to their contacts, technology can also make it easier to help patients figure out what to say (through [providing template language][51]) and [who to notify][52] (based on timing of test results & symptom onset). Ideally, patients would provide their contacts with links to information about where to get tested, guidance on whether to get tested, information about what symptoms to watch for, advice about isolation, and links to tools that would help contacts monitor their own symptoms.

### Tech-enabled recruiting and training of contact tracers

As we consider rapidly scaling up the contact tracing workforce, technology can play a vital role in recruiting, selecting, and training contact tracers.

[GC Talent Reserve][53] ([open source code][54]) is one example of how government can use technology to recruit contact tracers who are already government employees to fill emergency roles.

### Support people in isolation[at]

### Emerging Bluetooth technology solutions

In the last week, Apple and Google announced a partnership to leverage Bluetooth LE technology to support proximity tracking for volunteer participants. In theory, applications could use this technology to automate portions of contact tracing: once a diagnosed case is known, apps could identify other users who were in close proximity to the COVID-19-positive individual during the period of contagion.[1]

For privacy purposes, this technology relies on a "double opt-in" approach. Both diagnosed users and those they come into proximity with would have to opt in to the program in order to be traced.

While this technology has potential, it is in its early stages, and based on our review to date, we do not think it is ready for immediate adoption as a "load-bearing pillar" of contact tracing work for the following reasons:

  * Insufficient coverage. Since this approach is voluntary, coverage is limited to those who choose to participate. So if 40% of the population participates (likely a high estimate given adoption rates seen in other countries), it would still only cover 16% of the contacts required.[2] As a result, a scaled-up workforce to perform manual contact tracing would still be necessary even with broad opt-in adoption.
  * Potential for biased coverage. Moreover, we should expect adoption to be lower in vulnerable populations due to language barriers, technology access, and more. As a result, over-reliance on this approach could disproportionately divert resources from vulnerable populations.[au]
  * Still under development. Google and Apple will be launching APIs in May, which will delay the creation of applications. In addition, accurate proximity algorithms are still under development, and issues such as rates of false positives and margins of error are unknown.
  * Outstanding privacy and security questions. Based on our discussions, while Google and Apple are pursuing a privacy-centric approach, ensuring privacy in practice is another matter. We spoke with experts who expressed concern that location could potentially be inferred from proximity assuming an adversarial approach (i.e., hackers trying to hack it or aggressive nation states).
