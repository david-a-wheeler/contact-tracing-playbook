# Contact Tracing Playbook

We learn more about contact tracing for COVID-19 every day. This playbook collects what various government, policy, and public health communities have shared about scaling contact tracing programs. We link to resources, frameworks, and templates to help you consider how to implement basic contact tracing in your community. Note that high-risk communities \(e.g., correctional, healthcare, or long-term care\) may require additional support beyond the scope of this playbook.

This is a live document and will be changing as we learn more. Feel free to submit pull requests or edit on github. 

This playbook was written in collaboration with:

* [Resolve to Save Lives](https://resolvetosavelives.org/)
* Geometer
* [Vital Strategies](https://www.vitalstrategies.org/)
* [U.S. Digital Response](http://usdigitalresponse.org)
* [Lots of volunteers](about/authors.md)

Contact tracing is a core public health function, and the techniques and strategies for contact tracing are not new. The US governmentâ€™s [Center for Disease Control \(CDC\)](https://www.cdc.gov/) and the broader public health community [have long depended on contact tracing to](https://www.cdc.gov/eis/field-epi-manual/index.html) [help control highly communicable diseases](https://www.cdc.gov/eis/field-epi-manual/index.html) like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and syphilis.

In the battle against COVID-19, contact tracing is [one of five essential and interdependent public health strategies](https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/its-not-too-late-to-go-on-offense-against-the-coronavirus) \(along with social distancing, testing, isolation & quarantine, and treatment\) that will enable us to safely reopen society while continuing to flatten the curve.

While the techniques and strategies for contact tracing are not new, COVID-19's unprecedented scale and speed require we implement time-tested contact tracing strategies in new ways, using new tools and technologies. This will require substantial investments in time, resources, and budget, as well as continued collaboration across federal, state, and local health departments.
