# H1. Existing COVID-19 contact tracing programs

Governments can learn from the COVID-19 contact tracing programs being scaled by other state and local governments. 

### State

#### Massachusetts

Massachusetts established the country's first state-wide contact tracing program, the [Community Tracing Collaboration (CTC)][8], in early April with a budget of $44m and a plan to hire more than 1,000 contact tracers ([job posting][9]) for the state's 7 million residents. The CTC involves multiple state organizations, including the [Massachusetts Department of Public Health][10][ (MDPH)][10] and the [Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority][11][ (CHICA)][11], along with public health organization [Partners in Health (PiH)][12] and consulting firm [Accenture][13]. The CTC empowers the decentralized state's 351 local health departments to execute contact tracing in every city and town in Massachusetts, and had spoken to over 5,000 residents by the close of April.
